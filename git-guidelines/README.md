Git Guidelines
==============

 * Write well formed commit messages.
   
   Start off with a short summary, followed by a more explanatory text, if 
   necessary. For clearity, use bullet points (asterisks, with blank lines in
   between) and hanging indent.

 * Use present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug".
   
   This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like 
   git merge and git revert.


Workflow Example
----------------

 1. Pull to update your local master

    `git pull origin master`

 2. Checkout a feature branch (include Pivotal Story ID if available)

    `git checkout -b dorma-calculator-ad-25548339`

 3. Do work in your feature branch, committing early and often

 4. Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes

    ```
    git fetch origin master
    git rebase origin/master
    ```

 5. Interactive rebase (squash) your commits

    `git rebase -i origin/master`

 6. Merge your changes with master

    ```
    git checkout master
    git merge dorma-calculator-ad-25548339
    ```

 7. Push your changes to the upstream

    `git push origin master`
