Git Guidelines
==============


Workflow Example
----------------

 1. Pull to update your local master

    `git pull origin master`

 2. Checkout a feature branch (include Pivotal Story ID if available)

    `git checkout -b dorma-calculator-ad-25548339`

 3. Do work in your feature branch, committing early and often

 4. Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes

    ```
    git fetch origin master
    git rebase origin/master
    ```

 5. Interactive rebase (squash) your commits

    `git rebase -i origin/master`

 6. Merge your changes with master

    ```
    git checkout master
    git merge dorma-calculator-ad-25548339
    ```

 7. Push your changes to the upstream

    `git push origin master`


Commit Messages
---------------

 * Write well formed commit messages.
   
   Start off with a short summary, followed by a more explanatory text, if 
   necessary. For clearity, use bullet points (asterisks, with blank lines in
   between) and hanging indent.

 * Use present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug".
   
   This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like 
   git merge and git revert.


### Example

```
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent
```
