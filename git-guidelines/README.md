Git Guidelines
==============

 * Write well formed commit messages.
   
   Start off with a short summary, followed by a more explanatory text, if 
   necessary. For clearity, use bullet points (asterisks, with blank lines in
   between) and hanging indent.

 * Use present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug".
   
   This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like 
   git merge and git revert.
