Design Guidelines
=================

> Web pages can’t look the same in every browser. Users are in charge of how 
> they view the Web: form the browser they use, to font settings, etc. But now 
> they have even more control.

* Solve the parts not the problem. Roll up your sleeves and start breaking 
  things down into more accessible, smaller elements.

* Start from the barebones capabilities of small mobile devices first.

* Reevaluate early and often.

  * **Value**. Is it useful?
  * **Usability**. Is it easy to use?
  * **Adoptability**. Is it easy to start using?
  * **Desirability**. Is it fun and engaging?


Layout
------

* We should treat layout as an enhancement. Assume your first media query is 
  the absence of a media query.

* We’re not designing pages. We’re designing systems of content.


Grids and break points
----------------------

* Design grids from the smallest element up. This allows you to move away from 
  breakpoints connected to devices and instead focus on breakpoints connected 
  to your content.

* Breakpoints associated with your content are likely to have longevity beyond 
  the current set of devices being used to access Web sites.


Advertisement
-------------

* Ads are traditionally sold based on size and position on a page. Following 
  their responsive design, The Boston Globe sold ads based on how they are 
  promoted on the page instead.

* We need to start asking for change and making things happen.
