SEO Guidelines
==============

High-quality titles, descriptions and other relevant meta data can be displayed 
in Google’s search results, and can go a long way to improving the quality and 
quantity of your search traffic.


Managing descriptive titles
---------------------------

* Make sure every page on your site has a title specified in the `<title>` tag.

* Page titles should be descriptive and concise.

* Avoid keyword stuffing.

* Avoid repeated or boilerplate titles.


Including good meta properties
------------------------------

* Make sure that every public (indexed) page has a unique meta description.

* Include clearly tagged facts in the description. The meta description doesn’t 
  just have to be in sentence format; it’s also a great place to include 
  structured data about the page.
