HTML E-Mail Guidelines
===================

Building HTML e-mails isn't easy – actually it can be quite frustrating – 
since it forces you to go back to everything you hate about the old days of 
developing websites with tables for layout, inline styles, quirky rendering 
engines, etc. Ignoring all this HTML e-mails should still be nicely designed, 
but also kept somewhat basic.

> While it’s not without its challenges, rest assured it can be done. In my 
experience the key is to focus on three things. First, you should keep it 
simple. The more complex your email design, the more likely is it to choke on 
one of the popular clients with poor standards support. Second, you need to 
take your coding skills back a good decade. That often means nesting tables, 
bringing CSS inline and following the coding guidelines I’ll outline below. 
Finally, you need to test your designs regularly. Just because a template 
looks nice in Hotmail now, doesn’t mean it will next week. – [Email design guidelines][r1]

This document will do its best to help you through the jungle of quirks and 
problems you'll face when coding HTML e-mails, but first and foremost read 
these to articles published by Campaign Monitor:

Testing
----------

Testing HTML e-mails is a huge pain since you have to create test accounts at lots of ISP's, download and view e-mails in several different e-mail applications on different operation systems. To avoid all this and take away most of the horrors of HTML e-mail testing, we use [Campaign Monitor's email testing service][testing].
