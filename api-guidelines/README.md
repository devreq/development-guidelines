API Guidelines
==============

* User/password authentication via HTTP basic, since it's fast, doesn't 
  require more than `curl`, and you can even make some requests from a 
  browser. (We're using SSL on all ends, so there's no security issues.)

* Use HTTP verbs to mean something
  
  Any API consumer is capable of sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs, and 
  they greatly enhance the clarity of what a given request does. Itâ€™s 
  terrifying to use an API where a GET request can change the underlying data.

* Sensible resource names
  
  Having sensible resource names/paths (e.g., `/posts/23` instead of 
  `/api?type=posts&id=23`) improves the clarity of what a given request does. 
  Using URL parameters is fantastic for filtering, but if everything is based 
  on a single API endpoint and tons of parameters, the mental model required 
  to use it gets too complex very quickly.

* Examples that show the full request.
  
  **Request:**
  ```
  **GET** http://api.kundportalen.se/users.json
  ```
  
  **Expected Response:**
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
  
  [
    {
      "id": 535131,
      "name": "Bobby Idol"
    }
  ]
